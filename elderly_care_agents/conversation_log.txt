[2025-04-06 17:44:44.528870] ðŸ¤– Ollama:  I'm really sorry to hear that you don't feel well. It's important to take care of yourself when feeling unwell. Here are some suggestions:

1. Rest: Try to get as much sleep as possible. Lack of rest can make you feel worse and recovery may take longer.
2. Hydrate: Drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Water is best, but clear broth or fruit juices can also help.
3. Medication (if applicable): If you are currently on any medication, continue taking it as prescribed unless your doctor advises otherwise.
4. Nutrition: Try to eat light, easily digestible meals. Avoid rich, spicy foods that may upset your stomach further.
5. Fever: If you have a fever, use a thermometer to check your temperature regularly and monitor for any signs of worsening symptoms.
6. Seek help: If your symptoms persist or worsen, or if you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, chest pain, severe headache, or dizziness, seek medical attention immediately.
